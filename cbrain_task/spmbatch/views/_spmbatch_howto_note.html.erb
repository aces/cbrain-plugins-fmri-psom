  <h2>How to use SPM Batch Task</h2>

  <pre>
    Purpose:
    Execute a suite of spm_jobman for each subjects in a given dataset.
    spm_jobman require a Matlab script (.m or .mat) create by the tools
    SPM Batch Editor.

    A typical dataset for an fmri study should look like this
          study--&gt;subjects1--&gt;anatomicals    -&gt;some dicom files
               |           |--&gt;gre_field_map -&gt;some dicom files
               |           |--&gt;fmri_session1 -&gt;some dicom files
               |           |--&gt;fmri_session2 -&gt;some dicom file
               |           |   ...
               |           |--&gt;onset_for_fmri.m (optionnal)
               |           ...
               |
               |--&gt;subjects2--&gt;anatomicals
               |           |--&gt;gre_field_map -&gt;some dicom files
               |           |--&gt;fmri_session1 -&gt;some dicom files
               |           |--&gt;fmri_session2 -&gt;some dicom file
               |           |   ... 
               |           |--&gt;onset_for_fmri.m (optionnal)&gt;
               |           |...
               |--&gt; ...
               | ...


    Note: the name of anatomical and fmri directories between eachs subjects
    involved in the analysis should all have at least the same name and most
    of the time the same number of files inside

    SPM Batch pipeline will:
    1- Convert DICOM images into something SPM can use. (Two file (hdr+img) NIfTI)
    2- Create field maps and unwarping EPI if requested.
    3- Run from first to last a given matlab file list create by the tools SPM8 Batch Editor
       Note, Batch must have been save in text format (Matlab .m Script File)
    
    to do:
    1-convert .mat into .m when it's possible
    2- write back original path drive   
    3- makeSpmBatch sould be improve
    4-implement validation
    5-doing group analysis
    6-event specification for events related fmri (onset.m)
