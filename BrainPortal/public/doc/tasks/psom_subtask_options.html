<h1>Information about PsomSubtask</h1>

<p class="short_paragraphs">
A PsomSubtask is not actually a CBRAIN processing task
that users are expected to launch. Instead, it is an
internal system task running on a cluster intended to
encapsulate one PSOM job.
</p>

<p class="short_paragraphs">
PSOM is a pipeline execution framework developed by
Pierre Bellec and implemented in Octave. PSOM jobs
are often created to be part of larger scientific
pipelines, for instance Pierre's NIAK system.
</p>

<p class="short_paragraphs">
Even though PsomSubtask tasks will appear in a user's
CBRAIN tasklist, there are no parameters that can or
need to be adjusted.
